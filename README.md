Our project aim to enable the architect and the client to gain insight by using VR/AR glasses to increase efficiency for both the client and the architect in the field of interior architecture. While doing this, it also aims to provide a very effective experience by preserving the characteristics of the room with the systems used.

Consider reading our final report from [here](Reports/Final%20Report.pdf). 

Here are some highlighted works:

 1. Oculus Scene features that allows user to transfer information to application about the room
